The Colossal Adventure Game is a text-based game that was developed in the 1970s. In the game, the player controls a character through simple text commands to explore a cave rumored to be filled with wealth. Players earn predetermined points for acquiring treasure and escaping the cave alive, with the goal to earn the maximum number of points offered.

In this version of the game a player can type the direction that they would like to go in and the application responds accordingly. For example, a player can request “I want to go north” and the application determines whether they can go North — based 10 on direction / location .txt files. If they are able to go North then the application allows the player to go North, then lists the next set of directions (North, North East, West, etc) that are available to the player to navigate. This mapping from one direction to the next, depending on where the player wants to go, continues until the player quits the game, reaches a dead end and cannot return, or locates the pot of gold.

This program was done in Java when I was learning object-oriented programming. It also has test files.
